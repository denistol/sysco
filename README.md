### ðŸ§¾ Description
This test project is a web scraper that uses Puppeteer to obtain cookies and sends raw GraphQL-style POST requests to internal API to collect product and category data.

It:
- Parses paginated product listings from the Sysco or Grainger api.

- Stores product details (name, brand, image, availability, etc.).

- Extracts and deduplicates categories.

- Saves results into local JSON files (```data/sysco/products, data/sysco/categories, data/sysco/brands, data/grainger/products```).

### Dependencies and Utilities
`getCookies`: Uses Puppeteer to retrieve a fresh cookies and additional data for authenticated API access.
`write`: Utility to save data to disk.
`uniqBy`: From Lodash, used to deduplicate categories.
